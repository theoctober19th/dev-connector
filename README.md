## DevConnector

This is the first full-stack web application I built while learning to build web apps on MERN Stack. The technlogies used in this project are `Node.js`, `ExpressJS`, `MongoDB`, `Heroku`, `mongoose`, `ReactJs`, `Redux`, `Thunk`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

The Udemy course I followed is available at https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/.

The final app is live [here](https://devconnectorplus.herokuapp.com), if you want to have a look.

Happy coding!
